/******Inheritence******/
// To follow  baic rule of programming i.e. DRY(do not repeat yourself) we use inheritence
// inheritence is using of one class in another
// reusing already tested and debugged class(BASE CLASS) will save a lot of effort in developing new class(DERIVED CLASS)
// Types of inheritence ---> 1.single  2.Multiple  3.Hirerchical  4.multilevel  5.hybrid

/******Single inheritence********/
// A derived class with only one base class

/******Multiple Inheritence*******/
// A derived class with more than one base class

/*****Hierarchical inheritence*****/
// several derieved class from a single base class
// reverse of multiple inheritence

/*******Multilevel inheritence*****/
// Deriving a class from already derived class
// one of the class is not a base class

/*******Hybrid Inheritence*********/
// combination of multiple inheritence ans multilevel inheritence is hybrid inheritence
