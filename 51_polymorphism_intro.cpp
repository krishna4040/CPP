/******Polymorphism******/
//* Poly ---> Many     morphism ---> form
//* one name multiple forms
//* EX: function , operator , constructor overloading virtual functions
//* TYPES ---> 1. Compile time     2. Run time

/********Compile time polymorphism********/
//? object bounds to the function call during compile time
//? aka early binding or static binding
//? It is acheived using --->  1. function overloading   2. operator overloading  3.Function overriding

/*******Run time polymorphism********/
//! when comipler postpons the function call during compile time and executes it during run time
//! aka late binding
//! It is acheived using ---> 1. virtual functions
