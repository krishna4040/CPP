// c++ control structures
// Control structures provide logic in problem solving using programming
// Types of control structures
/*
    1.Sequence structure : normal execution of statements
    2.selection structure: execution of statements are based on a certain conditions.
        1.if else statement
        2.if else ladder
        3.swicth case
    3.loop structure : repeated execution of statements until a certain condition is true
        1.for statement
        2.while statement
        3.do while statement
