// We can use constructor during inheritence
// we can have constructors in both base and derieved class

// If base class constructor have no arguments there is no need of any const in derieved class
// but if base class const is parameterized than derieved class needs to pass arg to base class const
// if both base and derieved class have const than base class const is called first
